# Notes

Written for whoever picks this up next — including me. Everything here is
something I guessed at, left unfinished, or decided in a way that deserves a
second opinion.

## What was actually verified

| | |
|---|---|
| Rust tests | 133 passing (119 unit, 14 against a mocked Gmail API) |
| Clippy | clean with `-D warnings` |
| Frontend | type-checks and builds |
| App launches | **yes, on Linux** — built, launched, every screen exercised |
| Release workflow | **yes** — all four installers built in public CI, checksums verified |
| Real Gmail account | **no** — see below |
| macOS / Windows | **built, never run** — see below |

### Not tested against a real inbox

There were no Google credentials available, so **no code path that talks to
Google has run against Google.** The Gmail client, the OAuth flow and the
scanner are covered by tests against a mock server and a local loopback, which
catches shape and logic errors but not the things only reality produces:
Google's exact error bodies, real rate-limit behaviour, oddities in real
`From` headers, or whether the consent flow feels right end to end.

**Before recommending this to anyone, run it against a real account with dry run
on.** Dry run exercises everything except the final send.

Likewise, **no unsubscribe request has ever been sent to a real endpoint.** The
one-click POST is built and unit-tested but has never met a live marketing
platform.

### Only *run* on Linux

All four installers now build in CI — `.msi`, `.exe`, universal `.dmg`, `.deb`
and `.AppImage` — and a downloaded `.deb` verifies against the published
`SHA256SUMS`. But **the macOS and Windows binaries have never been launched by
anybody.** Building is not running: a missing runtime dependency, a broken
keychain call, or a window that opens blank would all sail through a green
build. Someone should open them before the draft release goes public.

The first release run also cost three attempts, which is worth recording since
it says something about the workflow rather than the app:

1. `macos-13` (Intel) runners never allocated — queued 20+ minutes while the
   other three finished in 4–6. Replaced with a single universal build.
2. The universal build compiled and then failed at the link with only one
   architecture installed. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain, so the
   toolchain action's `targets:` input put them where the build could not see
   them; an explicit `rustup target add` fixed it.
3. Green.

The AppImage step also fails on a sandboxed local machine because `linuxdeploy`
needs FUSE. On a CI runner it is fine.

## Things I had to guess at

### Gmail's quota numbers disagree between sources

Google's own [usage limits page](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/quota)
says `messages.get` costs **20** quota units. Several third-party summaries say
**5**. The per-user ceiling is documented as 6,000 units/minute; other sources
describe 250 units/second.

I couldn't resolve this, so I stopped trying to: the limiter in
`src-tauri/src/ratelimit.rs` starts conservatively and adapts to whatever the
real limit turns out to be, halving on any pushback. The published costs are
still in the code as starting values, and if they're wrong the loop absorbs it.

**Worth revisiting**: if the real numbers become clear, the `START_RATE` and
`MAX_RATE` constants could be tuned. A first scan of a large mailbox may be slow
— at 20 units per fetch and 100 units/second, 38,000 messages is over two hours.
That's why scan depth defaults to a year and why the scan is resumable.

### I skipped the batch endpoint

The brief asked for batching. I used HTTP/2 concurrency instead, and this is a
judgement call worth challenging.

Gmail's batch endpoint still exists (the *global* batch endpoint was shut down in
2020; the per-API one at `/batch/gmail/v1` was not). But Google's own docs say
batching **doesn't reduce quota** — *n* batched calls count as *n* calls. Quota
is the binding constraint here, not connection overhead, so batching would buy
round-trips we aren't short of while adding multipart assembly and parsing, and
a failure mode where one malformed part is harder to attribute.

If a real-world scan turns out to be latency-bound rather than quota-bound, this
decision is wrong and should be revisited.

### Google Cloud console URLs

The setup wizard deep-links to `console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding`,
`/auth/audience` and `/auth/clients` — the newer Google Auth Platform pages.
Google reorganised these once already and may again. **These are unverified: I
could not open them.** If setup reports are confusing, check these first
(`src/screens/Setup.tsx`).

### The client-secret format check

`ClientCredentials::validate` rejects anything not starting with `GOCSPX-`. That
prefix has been stable for years, but it is a Google implementation detail, not
a documented guarantee. If Google changes it, setup breaks with a confidently
wrong error message. The check exists because pasting the Client ID into both
boxes is a very common slip that otherwise fails much later and cryptically.

### The transactional heuristics are a starting point

The lists in `src-tauri/src/heuristics.rs` are Anglophone and incomplete —
mostly US and Western European institutions. They will miss banks and delivery
firms in most of the world.

The weights and the caution threshold (60) were set by hand until the test
fixtures behaved. They are not tuned against real data and probably should be.
Erring towards flagging is deliberate: a false positive costs one click, a false
negative costs someone a receipt.

## Decisions where I picked one way

### Both `mailto:` methods are implemented

The brief said pick one and document the trade-off. I built both, because the
trade-off is the user's to make rather than mine:

- **Hand off to their mail app** — the default. Needs no extra permission. Costs
  a click per sender.
- **Send via Gmail** — fully automatic, but requires `gmail.send`, which lets the
  app send mail as them. Off unless explicitly granted at the consent screen,
  and the app trusts what Google actually granted rather than what it asked for.

### Clearing out the backlog moves mail to Trash, never deletes it

Added after the first version, at the maintainer's request. Three decisions
inside it that another pair of eyes should check:

- **Only mail carrying an unsubscribe header is binned**
  (`Store::bulk_message_ids`). This reuses the unsubscribe gate, so a shop's
  order confirmations survive while its marketing goes. It is the reason the
  feature is safe at all, and there are tests pinning it.
- **`gmail.modify`, not `mail.google.com`.** The narrower scope permits
  trashing but not permanent deletion, so the app is structurally incapable of
  destroying anything even if the code were wrong.
- **`messages.trash`, not `batchModify` with a `TRASH` label.** Batching would
  be ~20x cheaper in quota (50 units per 1,000 vs 20 units each), but whether
  the API accepts `TRASH` via `addLabelIds` is disputed between sources and I
  could not settle it. A disputed reading is not something to lean on for a
  destructive call. **Worth revisiting** if someone confirms it: binning a
  600-message backlog currently takes a couple of minutes.

None of this has run against a real account either — see the top of this file.

### Subjects are stored locally

Needed by the safety heuristics — "your order has shipped" is exactly the signal
that earns a warning. Documented in the README rather than hidden.

### An unsubscribe URL is checked before anything is sent

Not in the brief, but the one-click URL comes from an email header, which means
a sender chooses it. Without a check, crafted mail could make the app POST to a
router admin page or a cloud metadata endpoint *from inside the user's network*.
`vet_destination` in `src-tauri/src/unsub.rs` resolves the host and refuses
anything not publicly routable.

**Known gap:** this is check-then-connect, so a DNS rebinding attack could still
slip through the window between the check and the request. Closing it properly
means a custom DNS resolver pinned to the vetted address. Given the attacker has
to control both the mail and the DNS, and the payload is a fixed form body, I
judged the remaining risk small — but it is a real gap, not an absent one.

### Header injection is refused rather than sanitised

A sender controls the `subject=` and address in their own `List-Unsubscribe`.
Line breaks are replaced with spaces, and an address that isn't a single plain
mailbox is rejected outright rather than cleaned up and used. There are tests
for both.

## Unfinished

### Reproducible builds

Claimed as a goal, not achieved. Done: pinned Rust toolchain
(`rust-toolchain.toml`), committed `Cargo.lock` and `package-lock.json`,
`CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, `codegen-units = 1`, `--remap-path-prefix` in the release
workflow, and SHA-256 checksums on every artifact.

Not done, and needed for byte-identical rebuilds: pinned system libraries and
linker, a fixed `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, deterministic archive ordering inside the
installers, and pinned runner images (currently floating tags like
`ubuntu-22.04`). The README says plainly that checksums probably won't match yet
and explains what *can* be verified today.

### Screenshot placeholders — six of them

All render as visible dashed frames, and each carries a description of what the
picture should show. Search the source for `<Screenshot`:

| File | Line | Should show |
|---|---|---|
| `src/screens/Setup.tsx` | 109 | Google Cloud's New Project form |
| `src/screens/Setup.tsx` | 135 | The Gmail API page with the Enable button |
| `src/screens/Setup.tsx` | 163 | The branding form, filled in |
| `src/screens/Setup.tsx` | 197 | The Audience page showing "Testing" and test users |
| `src/screens/Setup.tsx` | 221 | The Create OAuth client screen, "Desktop app" selected |
| `src/screens/Connect.tsx` | 104 | Google's consent screen |

The component is `Screenshot` in `src/components/ui.tsx`; replacing the frame
with an `<img>` there handles all six at once.

### Smaller gaps

- **One account at a time.** The database schema is keyed by account throughout,
  so multiple accounts would mostly work, but nothing in the interface offers it.
- **English only.** No i18n scaffolding at all.
- **Accessibility is reasoned, not tested.** Focus order, visible focus rings,
  ARIA labels on the drawn checkboxes, `role="alert"` on problems, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` are all in place. It has not been through a screen
  reader.
- **The app icon is mine, not a designer's.** `src-tauri/icons/source.png`, with
  a small script's worth of thought behind it. Regenerate with
  `npx tauri icon <file>`.
- **The CI "promises" job greps.** It catches embedded credentials, a `fetch` in
  the web layer, and a `format=full`. Greps are crude and a determined change
  would slip past; it's a tripwire, not a proof.
- **`resume_session` assumes keychain storage** when restoring on launch, so a
  memory-only session that somehow restored would be labelled wrongly. Harmless
  today because a memory-only token cannot survive a restart.

## Working on the interface without a Google account

`VITE_HUSH_DEMO=1 npm run dev` swaps the Rust backend for a fake one
(`src/devmock.ts`) with sample senders covering the awkward cases: a flagged
bank, a link-only sender, a mailto-only sender, and one already protected.

It's behind a compile-time constant so production builds drop it entirely, and
CI fails if it ever appears in `dist/`. This is how the list, confirm and results
screens were verified.
